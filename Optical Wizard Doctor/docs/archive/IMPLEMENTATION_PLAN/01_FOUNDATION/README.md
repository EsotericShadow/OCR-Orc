Establish the project infrastructure, core data structures, and basic UI framework. By the end of this phase, we should have an application that can load a PDF document and display it in a window.

## Sub-Projects

1. **Project Setup**
   - CMake configuration
   - Dependency management
   - Directory structure

2. **Core Modules**
   - Coordinate system implementation
   - Data models (Region, Group, Document)

3. **UI Framework**
   - Window setup
   - Basic layout (toolbar, canvas, side panel)

## Success Criteria

- Application compiles and runs
- Can load and display a PDF file
- Window is properly sized and responsive
- No crashes or memory leaks

## Estimated Time

2-3 weeks for an experienced C++ developer
