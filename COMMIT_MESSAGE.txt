Fix zoom display update and comprehensive theme/icon improvements

This commit addresses multiple UI/UX issues and implements a robust
theme-aware icon system with proper color management for light and dark modes.

## Zoom Display Fix
- Fixed zoom percentage not updating in toolbar when zooming with Cmd+mouse wheel
- Added consistent zoomChanged signal emission from Canvas for all zoom operations
  (zoomIn, zoomOut, zoomReset, wheelEvent)
- Connected zoomChanged signal directly to ToolbarWidget::updateZoomLabel
- Ensures real-time zoom percentage display during all zoom interactions

## Theme System Improvements
- Fixed text colors in dialogs to properly adapt to theme:
  * Light mode: black text on light backgrounds
  * Dark mode: white text on dark backgrounds
- Updated all region operation dialogs (name, color, edit, delete) to use
  ThemeManager colors instead of hardcoded values
- Applied theme-aware palette settings to all dialog widgets (QDialog, QLabel,
  QLineEdit, QPushButton, QComboBox)

## Icon System Overhaul
- Implemented separate icon files approach for reliable theme-based coloring:
  * Created white versions of all SVG icons (*_white.svg) for dark mode
  * Original black SVGs used for light mode
  * Total of 17 white icon variants created
- Fixed IconManager to use ThemeManager::getEffectiveTheme() instead of
  palette detection for accurate theme determination
- Added icon caching system with color-specific keys to prevent wrong caching
- Implemented refreshIcons() methods in:
  * ToolbarWidget (zoom, rotate, group, undo/redo buttons)
  * ControlPanelWidget (load PDF, export, load coordinates, edit selected)
  * SidePanelWidget (help button, group management buttons)
- All icons now automatically refresh when theme changes

## Icon Color Fixes
Fixed icons that were incorrectly showing black in dark mode:
- Toggle rotate button (now white in dark mode)
- Edit selected button (now white in dark mode)
- Load coordinates button (now white in dark mode)
- Export button (now white in dark mode)
- Upload PDF button (now white in dark mode)
- Create group button in sidebar (now white in dark mode)
- Add to group button in sidebar (now white in dark mode)
- Remove from group button in sidebar (now white in dark mode)
- Help button question mark (now white in dark mode)

## Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed unused parameter warnings by implementing actual functionality:
  * documentState parameter in autoIncrementRegionName now used for validation
  * generateRegionName callback now properly passed and used in dialogs
  * parentWidget parameter now used for proper dialog parenting
  * getRegion callback now used for region validation
  * context parameter in customMessageHandler now used for file/line logging
- Improved debug output in IconManager with detailed SVG color replacement logging
- Enhanced error handling and validation in region operations

## UI Cleanup
- Removed test extraction button completely (feature not implemented):
  * Removed from ControlPanelWidget header and implementation
  * Removed getter method
  * Removed button creation and styling code
  * Cleaned up all references

## Technical Details
- IconManager now uses ThemeManager singleton for theme detection
- Icon cache cleared on theme change to force regeneration
- QCoreApplication::processEvents() used during icon refresh to ensure
  proper icon clearing before setting new icons
- All icon loading now uses theme-aware file selection (black vs white SVGs)
- Delete and clear icons remain red in both themes (using color replacement)

## Files Modified
- Canvas.cpp: Added zoomChanged signal emissions
- MainWindow.cpp: Added icon refresh calls in applyTheme()
- MainWindowWidgetConnections.cpp: Connected zoomChanged signal
- ToolbarWidget.cpp/h: Added refreshIcons() method, updated to refresh rotate button
- ControlPanelWidget.cpp/h: Added refreshIcons() method, removed test extraction button
- SidePanelWidget.cpp/h: Enhanced refreshIcons() to include group buttons
- IconManager.cpp/h: Complete overhaul for theme-aware icon loading with caching
- MainWindowRegionOperations.cpp: Fixed theming and implemented unused parameters
- main.cpp: Enhanced logging with file/line information

## New Files
- 17 new white icon SVG files (*_white.svg) for dark mode support

This commit significantly improves the application's theme consistency and
user experience, ensuring all UI elements properly adapt to light and dark
modes with correct icon and text colors throughout the interface.
